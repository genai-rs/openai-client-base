/// MessagePhase : Labels an `assistant` message as intermediate commentary (`commentary`) or the final answer (`final_answer`). For models like `gpt-5.3-codex` and beyond, when sending follow-up requests, preserve and resend phase on all assistant messages — dropping it can degrade performance. Not used for user messages.  Use `commentary` for an intermediate assistant message and `final_answer` for the final assistant message. For follow-up requests with models like `gpt-5.3-codex` and later, preserve and resend phase on all assistant messages. Omitting it can degrade performance. Not used for user messages.
