## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**metadata** | Option<**std::collections::HashMap<String, String>**> | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.  Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.  | [optional]
**top_logprobs** | Option<**i32**> | An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.  | [optional]
**temperature** | Option<**f64**> | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.  | [optional]
**top_p** | Option<**f64**> | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.  | [optional]
**user** | Option<**String**> | This field is being replaced by `safety_identifier` and `prompt_cache_key`. Use `prompt_cache_key` instead to maintain caching optimizations. A stable identifier for your end-users. Used to boost cache hit rates by better bucketing similar requests and  to help OpenAI detect and prevent abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#safety-identifiers).  | [optional]
**safety_identifier** | Option<**String**> | A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. We recommend hashing their username or email address, in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#safety-identifiers).  | [optional]
**prompt_cache_key** | Option<**String**> | Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests to optimize your cache hit rates. Replaces the `user` field. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching).  | [optional]
**service_tier** | Option<[**models::ServiceTier**](ServiceTier.md)> |  | [optional]
