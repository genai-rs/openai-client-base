# ResponseStreamOptions

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**include_obfuscation** | Option<**bool**> | When true, stream obfuscation will be enabled. Stream obfuscation adds random characters to an `obfuscation` field on streaming delta events to normalize payload sizes as a mitigation to certain side-channel attacks. These obfuscation fields are included by default, but add a small amount of overhead to the data stream. You can set `include_obfuscation` to false to optimize for bandwidth if you trust the network links between your application and the OpenAI API.  | [optional]
